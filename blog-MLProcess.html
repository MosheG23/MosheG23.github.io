                    <h4>What?</h4>
                    <p>One of the most frequently used buzzword in the world of data is <b>Machine
                            Learning</b>.
                        <br>First of
                        all it's importent to understand that machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI. Machine Learning
                        uses data to generate statistical code that
                        will output the right result, based on the pattern recognized from previous examples of
                        input.<br>But how do we create this model that thinks like an human? Most machine learning
                        project go through same 8 steps to create the model, I will try to explain each step briefly.
                    </p>
                    Proper disclosure the decision on how to divide the steps, is my opinion only and can be considered
                    as
                    guidelines for you.
                    <hr class="style3">
                    <h4>Step 1 - Define the Machine Learning Problem Framing</h4>
                    <p>The first step we need to do is to define our objectives and evaluate the problem that we are
                        facing. <br>In Machine Learning
                        our prediction are divided to 3 different main classification, depends on the ML
                        Problem we need to answer:
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Binary classification</li>
                            Predict the answer to a <b>Yes/No</b> question.
                            <li>Multiclass solution</li>
                            Predict the correct <b>category</b> from a list.
                            <li>Regression</li>
                            Predict the <b>value</b> of a numeric value.
                        </ol>
                        For example in the article built a model to decide if the image is a dog or not - a binary
                        classification problem.
                    </p>

                    <hr class="style3">
                    <h4>Step 2 - Data Collection and Integration</h4>
                    <p>Data is everywhere and because it is everywhere, it can be collected from multiple sources like
                        Internet, Databases, other types of Storage. Chances are, that some of the data you
                        collect going to be <b>noisy</b> - your data is
                        possibly incomplete even irrelevant. <br>So,
                        wherever it comes from, it will need to be compiled - get integrated. Most importantly, you have
                        to <b>clean</b> the data. First, you need to collect and integrate the data that's relevant to
                        your
                        problem. No matter what type of data you're collecting, you're going to need to make sure that
                        you've got the proper tools and the knowledge to work with all different datatypes.
                    </p>
                    <p>This step is very important because the quality and quantity of data that you gather will
                        directly determine how accurate your model can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a survey made by JetBrains in 2019 they asked the question "What do you use Python for?", the
                        first answer was Data Analysis! python considered to be a good tool for working with data, the
                        main
                        libraries are <b>Pandas</b> which is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool, and
                        <b>NumPy</b> which adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a
                        large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Master those
                        two and job will be much easier.
                        <br>I highely recommended to use those libary documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this step we will obtain as much data as we can. If we will find irrelevant data for our
                        purpose, such as the name of the owner and etc, we will keep the data we need.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="style3">
                    <h4>Step 3 - Data Preparation</h4>
                    <p>In the data prep phase, the main task is to manually and critically explore the data. You've got
                        to look at it closely. Ask yourself questions like this, what features are there? That Step 1.
                        Does it match your expectations? Is there enough information to make accurate predictions? If
                        you just looked at it, what are you going to see? Here is a good rule of thumb. <i>If we as
                            human, could look at a given data point and guess the correct label, then an ML algorithm
                            should be
                            successful there too.</i>
                    </p>
                    <hr class="style3">
                    <h4>Step 4 - Data Visualization and Analysis</h4>
                    <h6>Data Visualization</h6>
                    <p>It can be hard to understand your data without seeing the data. That's why you need to do more
                        than just a manual analysis, you need a programmatic analysis. This is what you get when you
                        visualize the data. It's a technique that helps you understand the relationships within your
                        dataset. This leads to better features, better models. When you can see the data in a chart or
                        plotted out, you can help unveil previously unseen patterns. It reveals corrupt data or outliers
                        that you don't want, properties that could be very significant in your analysis.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/blog/mlprocess/10-types-of-data-visualization.jpg" class="blog-img" alt="" />
                    <p>There are many different plots that can visualize the data. Each plot can help us, and show us
                        different information. Scatter plot will help us show the relationship between the features and
                        the labels and see if there is a correlation between them.</p>
                    <p>A model will suffer because of noisy data points like outliers or missing data. This results in
                        less accurate predictions. So, we've been talking about in order to get accurate predictions,
                        you have to get clean data. But there's more to that. You need an algorithm that makes sense for
                        your business problem. Choosing the right algorithm for the job is another big step in this part
                        of the ML pipeline.</p>
                    <h6>Analysis</h6>
                    <p>After we cleaned the data, using data visualization, from the noisy data. Another crucial step in
                        the pipeline is selecting the right algorithm for the job. The number of algorithms is growing
                        in our time. The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data
                        they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.
                    </p>
                    The four main algorithms are:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Supervised </li>
                        Our labels and data will be known to us.
                        <li>Unsupervised</li>
                        Our labels and data will not be known to us. We can try to use Clustering – the machine will try
                        to use the data point, and divide the information to groups based on the points. He will do it
                        by finding patterns.
                        <li>Reinforcement</li>
                        In this algorithm the agent we make actions, and based on those actions, he will look on the
                        changes to the environment and reward the action based on the success
                        <li>Deep Learning</li>
                        This is a subject for a few different posts. Deep Learning takes Machine Learning a step
                        further. Rather than telling the machine what features it needs to look for, Deep Learning
                        enables the machine to define the features it needs to look for itself based on the data it's
                        being provided. Deep Learning processes information using similar but artificial processing
                        structures known as artificial neural networks (ANN).
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here we will take a dive with the data. Find correlation in our data, what data has influence on
                        our result and what only disturb our data.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="style3">
                    <h4>Step 5 - Feature Selection</h4>
                    <p>A feature is an attribute or property shared by all of the independent units on which analysis or
                        prediction is to be done. Any attribute could be a feature, as long as it is useful to the
                        model.<br>
                        The purpose of a feature, other than being an attribute, would be much easier to understand in
                        the
                        context of a problem. <br>A feature is a characteristic that might help when solving the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>In this important step, we will look for features that correlate to our desired output. A
                        crucial part in this step is Feature Engineering – the process of manipulating the original data
                        into new and potentially a lot of more useful features.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="style3">
                    <h4>Step 6 - Training</h6>
                        <p>Benjamin Franklin once said: <i>"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve
                                me and I learn"</i>. The training often considered the bulk of machine learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first step we do when we start to train the data is to split the data to 2 sections:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Training Data – The data will include both the labels and the features</li>
                                <li>Test Data – only features</li>
                            </ul>
                            In order to avoid the model be bias we will randomize the sections. Another subject we want
                            to
                            avoid is overfitting – the model learns the particulars of dataset to well – or underfitting
                            where will not have enough features to model the data properly.</p>
                        <p>We can measure this in 2 characteristics. <b>Bias</b> which is the gap between predicted
                            value and
                            actual value, and <b>Variance</b>, how dispersed your predicted values are.

                        <h4>Step 7 - Model Evaluation</h4>
                        <p>One of the most effective ways to evaluate your model's accuracy, precision, and ability to
                            recall involves looking at something called a confusion matrix. Now, the <b>confusion
                                matrix</b>
                            analyzes the model and shows how many of the data points were predicted correctly and
                            incorrectly.

                        <h4>Step 8 - Predictions</h4>
                        <p>We can finally use our model to predict whether a given drink is dog ot not. <br>The word
                            “prediction” can be misleading. In some cases, it really does mean that you are predicting a
                            future outcome, other times, though, the “prediction” has to do with something that already
                            occurred.

                            same thing in a different guise, every devloper has his own preferences!<br>
                            In machine learning it's highly importent to work oragnize to reach our goals. Hope you
