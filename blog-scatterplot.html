          <h2>What?</h2>
          <p>One of the more simple but yet still very informative for correlation between variables we have the
            <b>Scatter
              Plot</b>.
            This plot uses dots to represent values for two numeric variables. Unlike heat map (another plot to check
            correlation), in this plot we observe relationships between variables.<br>
            Relationships between variables can be described in many ways: positive or negative, strong or weak, linear
            or nonlinear.</p>

          <img src="assets/img/blog/scatterplot/scatter1.PNG" class="blog-img">

          <p>Continuing with the basketball theme, in the plot above we have two variables:
            <ol>
              <li>The average  of team
                points a team scored in a season</li>
              <li>Year</li>
            </ol>
            From the plot we can infer that we have a good correlation between the variables. There is a <b>strong,
              positive
              and linear</b>
            correlation between variables - the more we progress with the
            years, the more points team scores.</p>

          <p>But we can see one more thing - there are outliners! (what we can
            about them is a subject for a different post). This plot is useful for identifying other <b>patterns</b> in
            data,
            based on how closely sets of dots cluster together we can divide the them to groups, also it's possible to
            show gaps in the values if there are any.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Avoid from</h2>
          <h5>Overplotting</h5>
          <p>When we have lots of dots to plot, this can run into the issue of <b>overplotting</b>. There a saying -
            "all covet all lose" - When your dataset is large, the dots of your scatterplot will tend to overlap, making
            the plot unreadable.</p>

          <img src="assets/img/blog/scatterplot/scatter2.PNG" class="blog-img">

          <p>There are a few common ways to solve this problem:
            <dl>
              <dt>Decreasing dot size</dt>
              <dd>The easiest solution is reduce the dot size - the success in this is depend on the quantity of overlap
                you have. In combination with decreasing dot size, using transparency of the dots can also allows you to
                reveal patterns in the data.</dd>
              <dt>Sampling</dt>
              <dd>Sometimes less is more! try to plot some percentage of the data - choose wisely!</dd>
              <dt>Marginal distribution</dt>
              <dd>It's possible to add a plot, such a boxplot, a histogram or a density plot in the margins</dd>
              <dt>Try different plot</dt>
              <dd>Tried everything and more? Still need to find correlation between the variable and the scatter didn't
                help?
                don't be one trick pony - maybe heatmap or bubble chart might do the job</dd>
            </dl>
          </p>

          <h5>The Hidden Variable</h5>
          <p>Another subject to stay away from is jumping fast to conclusion. Just because we found a relationship
            between two variables in a scatter plot, it does not mean that changes in one variable are responsible for
            changes in the second.
            In statistics there a common saying that correlation does not imply causation. It's possible that there is
            a third variable that affect both, or, pure coincidence might cause an apparent correlation.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Extra Features</h2>
          <h5>Trend Line</h5>
          <p>Trend Line (or Line of Best Fit) refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses
            the relationship between those points.
            A straight line will result from a simple linear regression analysis of two or more independent variables. A
            regression involving multiple related variables can produce a curved line in some cases.
          </p>
          <h5>Third Variable</h5>
          <p>A common use in the scatter plot is adding a third variable. Adding this variable add information that can
            help us infer about the relations between the variables.
          </p>
          <h5>Annotations</h5>
          <p>An annotation is extra information associated with a particular point in a document or other piece of
            information. The scatter plot is highly customizable - it's possible to add text to dot, change the color,
            shape and etc.
            For example let's look the plot at the title:
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/blog/scatterplot/title.PNG" class="blog-img-bigger">
          <p>The plot has two variables:
            <ol>
              <li>The percent of three point (success / all shots)</li>
              <li>Total 3 point scored in a year</li>
            </ol>
            If we observe this two variable, we can learn that the more the dot is more towards to the right side and
            higher he
            is a more efficient shooter.
            <br>By adding text near the dot we can learn if the year affect about those 2 variable, information we can't
            learned from the scatter solely. I also added the player name and afterwars I can check the player
            furthermore.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Personal Take</h2>
          <p>So the big question after all is why to use scatter plot?<br>
            Scatterplots is an easy plot to use, he is one of the first plot that I used. Despite easy to use, it
            doesn't mean that the plot won't be useful only to "beginners". The plot is highly customizable and can have
            many often use cases. If you master this plot he can be a very powerful tool for data visualization.
